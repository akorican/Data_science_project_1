# Description of data and research intention

### Data:
During the time period from the 6th of December 2021 up to the 19th of May 2022, I was summarizing the data about my own body mass, walking activity as well as ingestion of carbohydrates, fats and proteins per day. 

The features that were observed are listed here as follows:
* <b>body mass: </b>body mass was measured each morning immediately after getting up

* <b>number of steps, distance in km, calories burned by walking : </b>measured through smartphone's built-in accelerometer e.g. smartphone app

* <b>estimated index for carbohydrates, fats and proteins: </b><br>
0 - no food items of such kind ingested this day<br>
1 - optimal quantity of food items of such kind in a day (Attention: This is my personal estimation!)<br>
2 - quantity of food items of such kind two times bigger as optimal (Attention: This is my personal estimation!)<br>
3 - quantity of food items of such kind three times bigger as optimal (Attention: This is my personal estimation!)<br>

### Research intention:
* to investigate analytically the dependence of body mass on walking activity and the type and kind of nutrition
* to develop a machine learning model that predicts a body mass change based on walking activity and nutrition in the preceding days
